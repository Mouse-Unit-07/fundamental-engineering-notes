## Overview

- "Company culture" refers to unspoken shared rules of a community
- In complex environments where decisions need to be made for the team over individuals, company culture is what lets teams work to together to face uncertainty as one group

## Circumstances in Which Unstructured Groups Work

- Camille Fournier in _The Manager's Path_ quotes Jo Freeman in "The Tyranny of Structurelessness"
- Small startups and unstructured groups work when they're:
- Task oriented
  - Functions are narrow and specific
  - Small and clear purpose serves as structure and a guide for what needs to be done next
- Small and homogenous
  - Homogeneity provides a "common language" for interaction
  - Lack of diversity allows for everyone to understand each other
- Communicating often
  - Information passed to everyone, opinions checked, work divided up, and participation assured in relevant decisions
  - Only possible in a structureless group when the group is small
- Low in skill specialization
  - As in, people are capable of doing multiple things where no one is indispensable
  - People are interchangeable w/ one another

## Company Size and Implications

- People
  - More people means more thoughtful structure you need to get people moving in the right direction
  - To enact the wishes of leaders and teams, structure is needed
- Age
  - The older the company, the more habits are entrenched, and the more likely it is to survive
- Size of existing infrastructure
  - Less business rules (how customers are charged, etc), code, and physical infrastructure (stores, warehouses, inventory), the less need for structure
  - The more business rules and infrastructure, the more clarity you need to handle them
- Risk tolerance
  - The more people you have depending on you and the larger the business, the less risk you're wiling to take

## Core Values

- Founders of companies will establish core values reflecting the company culture
- Employees are measured against core values, and will be reinforced/recognized/rewarded for exhibiting the core values
  - On the other hand, if you disagree w/ core values, you'll experience friction
- Applying core values
  - Your job as a leader/manager is to enforce core values:
  - Define your culture
    - Map company values to your team, and add some extra values if desired for your team
  - Reward and recognize those that exhibit core values in a positive way
    - This can be in performance reviews, shout outs, etc
  - Find those that have values that conflict w/ the company or team
    - Pushing off work to others, criticizing every idea, etc as they go against company/team values
  - Use it as a part of the interview process
    - See whether individuals meet company core values
    - You're not looking for friends- put your biases aside

## Encourage Diversity

> So many times, our goal in hiring is to hire another one of me so I have less work to do. It makes things faster if you can just hire a me-clone: someone who speaks the same language, has the same cultural background so the idioms and in-jokes are understood, and uses the same frame of reference.
>
> This is shortsighted. While you may be completely awesome, in the long term, diversity pays huge dividends by providing more points of view to a problem.
>
> We need the arguers and the mediators, we need the ones who think in a straight line and the ones who go in circles or jump around, we need people who grew up with a different idea of inexpensive, the person who travels at light speed, and the people who can make sure they are going in the right direction.
>
> It isn’t diversity of skin color, age, gender, or anything like that; it is diversity of thought that is critical. Funny thing though: the bodies get different experiences based simply on the bodies, so to get diversity of thought, you need diversity of everything else.
>
> This is very hard in a small company. There is the need to move fast, and lacking diversity means maybe going faster (by not having to explain why something is important). But faster is not success. You can shoot yourself in the foot mighty quickly.

- Elicia White in _Making Embedded Systems_

> ... and you, Marcus, you have given me many things; now I shall give you this good advice. Be many people. Give up the game of being always Marcus Cocoza. You have worried too much about Marcus Cocoza, so that you have been really his slave and prisoner. You have not done anything without first considering how it would affect Marcus Cocoza’s happiness and prestige. You were always much afraid that Marcus might do a stupid thing, or be bored. What would it really have mattered? All over the world people are doing stupid things ... I should like you to be easy, your little heart to be light again. You must from now, be more than one, many people, as many as you can think of ...

- Karen Blixen, in _The Dreamers_ from _Seven Gothic Tales_

## Processes

> I’ve had to deal with many different engineering processes over the years. I remember the first time I worked in a code base with unit tests that we were expected to run before checking in code. I was very diligent about doing this, and very upset every time someone broke the build because she hadn’t bothered to make sure her change didn’t break the tests. I also remember the first time I had an engineering process forced upon me that I hated. After years of no required code reviews, no ticketing, and no tracking, a central bureaucracy decided that everyone had to adopt all of these measures at once in a push for standard software development lifecycle management. It felt unnecessary, slow, and burdensome, and no one bothered to explain to us why these changes were happening.
>
> Engineering processes are the place where the rubber meets the road when it comes to structure. Career ladders, values, team structures—all of those are easy compared to the general angst and frustration that you can cause by adopting the wrong engineering processes for your teams. Without any process, your teams will struggle to scale. With the wrong process, they will be slowed down. Balancing the current size and risk tolerance of your team with the processes at hand is the essence of guiding good software development and operational guidelines.

- Employing processes:
  - Add processes around work coordination to make risks obvious
  - Complicated processes are for rare activities where risk is low
    - So code reviews shouldn't be too onerous that it slows down minor changes
  - Look out for where there are hidden risks
    - The value in processes is to highlight risk in changes to the whole team

## Social Organizational Archetypes

- Pathological
  - Driven by fear and threat
  - People hoard information for political reasons, or distort it to make themselves look better
  - Failures are hidden
- Bureaucratic
  - Driven by rules and processes to help individuals maintain their “turf”
  - Failures are processed through a system of judgement, resulting in punishment, or justice and mercy
- Generative
  - Driven by actively seeking information and sharing information to better enable an organization to achieve its mission
  - Responsibilities are shared throughout the value stream, and failure results in reflection and genuine inquiry

## Spoken/Unspoken Rules

- Companies have both spoken and unspoken rules
- Unspoken rules make it harder for new people to assimilate
  - It makes both the mentee and mentor's job harder
  - Regardless of which side you're on, try to clarify
- Spoken
  - Standard vacation policy in the HR handbook, etc
- Unspoken
  - Don't take vacation the week after Thanksgiving- it's an important week for business (or anything along these lines)
  - How long you're expected to struggle w/ something before you ask someone for help

## Startups

- > Early startups attract people who are capable of dealing with extremely high amounts of uncertainty and risk in exchange for equally high degrees of freedom to operate. There is no long-term guarantee that the company will succeed or even continue to exist for very long, no matter how strong the idea seems on paper. Often the market is unproven. Some signs look good and other signs look bad. There may be fierce competition from other companies, big and small. Furthermore, there is very little established work to build on. The code is unwritten. The business rules are not set up. It is hard to overstate how many decisions need to be made in the context of a startup, even one that has been growing for a couple of years. Everything from deciding on technology frameworks to deciding on office decorations is up for grabs.
  - Camille Fournier in _The Manager's Path_

## Structure

> Structure is how we scale, diversify, and take on more complex long-term tasks. We do it to our software, we do it to our teams, and we do it to our processes. In the same way that strong technical systems designers are capable of identifying and shaping underlying system structures, strong leaders are capable of identifying and shaping underlying team structures and dynamics, and doing so in a way that supports the long-term goals of the team and equips the individuals to achieve their best.
>
> Nothing is more ridiculous than a small team with a rigid hierarchy. We would all think that a team of five people where the fifth reported to the fourth, who reported to the third, who reported to the second, who reported to the first was pretty strange and probably unnecessary. Similarly, if a team of five in a struggling business spent most of their time in meetings deciding which toilet paper to stock in the bathroom, their priorities would seem skewed. Structure can come too early, and cause harm by slowing down a group that should be focused on other things.
>
> However, it’s more common in small companies to see structure come too late. The problems creep up slowly. One person gets used to making all of the decisions and changing his mind frequently. This strategy works fine when it’s just him and a couple of others. But when he keeps doing it with a team of 10, a team of 20, a team of 50, what you start to see is a high degree of confusion and wasted effort. The cost to change his mind becomes more and more expensive.

## Team Binding

- It's important for a team to have identity without undermining the identity of the whole company
- Shallow binding
  - A team that feels superior to the rest of the company is:
  - Fragile to loss of a leader
  - Resistant to outside ideas
  - Building a fragile empire
  - Inflexible
- Purpose-based binding
  - A team working under clear goals, and working on cultivating strengths is:
  - Resilient to loss of individuals
  - Driven to find better ways to achieve purpose
  - First-team focused
  - Open to changes that serve their purpose

## Technical Organizational Archetypes

- Functional-oriented
  - Optimize for expertise, division of labor, or cost
  - Centralize expertise, and tend to have tall hierarchical organizational structures
  - Creates creativity and motivation vacuums
- Matrix-oriented
  - Attempt to combine functional and market orientation
  - Result in complex organizational structures, where engineers report to multiple managers, sometimes achieving neither functional or market orientation goals
- Market-oriented
  - Optimized for responding quickly to customer needs
  - Flat- tend to be composed of multiple cross-disciplines (marketing, engineering, etc), which often lead to redundancies across organization
  - This is how prominent organizations adopting DevOps operate

## Understanding Company Purpose

- Getting a grasp on why the company exists takes time
  - This is especially true for small companies and startups
