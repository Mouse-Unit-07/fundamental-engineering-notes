## Overview

> Benign neglect isn't so bad when you consider some of the alternatives. There are the neglectful managers who ignore you when you need help and brush your concerns aside, who avoid meeting with you and who never give you feedback, only to tell you suddenly that you are not meeting expectations or not qualified to be promoted. And of course there are micromanagers who question every detail of everything you do and refuse to let you make any decisions on your own. Still worse are actively abusive managers who neglect you until they want to yell at you for something. Sadly, all of these characters are walking around our companies, wreaking havoc on the mental health of their teams. When you believe that these are the only alternatives, a manager who leaves you alone most of the time unless you specifically ask for help doesn't seem so bad at all.
>
> There are, however, other options. Managers who care about you as a person, and who actively work to help you grow in your career. Managers who teach you important skills and give you valuable feedback. Managers who help you navigate difficult situations, who help you figure out what you need to learn. Managers who want you to take their job someday. And most importantly, managers who help you understand what is important to focus on, and to enable you to have that focus.
>
> At a minimum, there are a few tasks that you should expect your manager to perform as needed, in order to keep you and your team on track. As you learn what to expect from your manager, you can start to ask for what you need.

## Choose Managers Wisely

- Managers make a difference in your career
  - A strong manager knows how to play the game at their company (promotions, getting attention, feedback from people, networks)
  - Weak managers don't know how to deal w/ politics or leadership in their companies

## Clarify Your Goals

- After clarifying what you want as an engineer, you can present it to your manager for your manager to direct you to appropriate projects
- Managers can't read minds- you have to present what you want
  - Talking about your agendas is great for 1-1s
  - If you want a promotion/raise, you have to ask for it
  - If you're unhappy w/ something, you have to bring it up
- Uncertainty
  - ...ofc you never really know what you want until you have some experience
  - Startups can be a mess, being a manager can be less rewarding than you would've imagined, etc
  - Only you can swim through that uncertainty and make decisions based on how you feel

## Do You Need a Mentor?

- Mentors help you navigate through what you need to do as an employee
- ...but sometimes (maybe if you don't have a mentor) what you need is a friend, therapist, or coach

## Doubling Rule

- Whenever you're asked how long it'll take to do something, it's rule of thumb to take your guess and double it
- When there are a bunch of unknowns, tasks can take a lot longer than double an estimate- careful planning is needed before throwing out a guess
- ...It's also annoying/distracting when a manager randomly asks for project estimates
  - Managers need to know they're responsible for handling uncertainty
  - If they're asking while knowing that, then you need to provide rough estimates and apply the doubling rule
    - After making a vague guess, make sure to remember if the guess was an undershoot and why

## Give Your Manager A Break

- Managers can say dumb things, or do things that are unfair or harmful to you
- You can get work that you don't want to do, and get annoyed when you complain about doing it
- A manager's job is to do what's best for the company, not to make you happy all the time
- So provide feedback to your manager
  - They might not listen- you can go ahead and try to change teams, or find a new job
  - If you start to feel that every manager you work w/ has a problem, then you need to think about whether the problem is you (maybe you're not capable of working under a manager)
- As you become senior, tone down the demanding and ask for advice instead
  - Asking for advice is how you show respect and trust

## Performance Improvement Plans

- Aka, getting "pip"ed
- When a company wants to fire someone, they'll usually be put on a "performance improvement plan"
- Depending on the company, this can actually be an effort to get the employee to turn around, but often times it's just a roundabout way to fire people
  - The plan'll list a whole bunch of tasks that are impossible to meet, providing time for the employee to find another job

## Peter Principle

- > In a hierarchy, employees tend to rise to their level of incompetence
  - Laurence J. Peter (1996)
- Due to the lack of training programs, companies that aren't aware of the different skills required for higher roles, and impatient management, engineers can be promoted to their level of incompetence
- When someone isn't capable of a leadership or management position they're promoted to, they stay there and serve as dead weight / shackle to the organization
- When working in an organization that isn't aware of these different skill requirements, employees need to be aware of what they need to know before accepting a role that prevents them from learning what they should've known when accepting the role
  - You should have the qualities required for the next role before you actually have it

## Roadmap Uncertainty

- To handle uncertainty, employ below:
- Understand the likelihood of changing plans
  - W/ some experience and given the size and stage of the company you work for, you can expect changes in plans
  - Don't promise your team anything that would require continuity past a point of likely change in plans
- Break projects down into smaller deliverables
  - This way you can prioritize certain details even if you don't finish everything
- Don't over promise new projects
  - Promising interesting projects "later" just serves to disappoint
  - Talk just about the near and probable future
- Dedicate 20% to "sustaining engineering"
  - Again, this means refactoring, fixing outstanding bugs, improving engineering practices, minor cleanup, providing ongoing support, etc
  - 20% is essential to avoid negative consequences, missed delivery goals, unplanned/unpleasant cleanup work, but not enough to overhaul large projects
- Understand the importance of various engineering projects
  - Aside from business/product, engineering in and of itself has a measure of project importance
  - Ask:
    - How big is that project?
    - How important is it?
    - Can you articulate the value of that project to anyone who asks?
    - What would successful completion of the project mean for the team?

## Talk to Others

- A workplace is made of humans and their interactions
- It's crucial to build a strong network of trusted people to share information and ideas w/ when building a career
- Don't abuse your seniors (or better yet anyone)- the tech world is small

## Up or Out

- Many organizations expect entry level engineers to climb the career ladder w/in a certain amount of time
- If they don't, they're targeted for being fired

## Work-Life Balance

- Your manager can't enforce any work-life balance
- All companies have a company culture that you can't overhaul
  - Sometimes you need to work more to get bigger jobs
  - Not everything will be fun all the time
- You won't get everything that you ask for either, but you're sure to not get anything if you don't speak up
- If you want change, speak up to let your manager know about it, and act accordingly based on how things do/don't change

## Your Ally

- Your manager needs to be your ally
- You should be able to sit w/ your manager and talk about what areas you should improve on to get promoted (if desired)
  - On the other hand, if you don't speak up, there's no obligation for you to be magically promoted
- If there's trouble w/ a teammate or person from another team that's not easily resolvable, you to bring it up to your manager
  - Just like promotions, the problem won't magically disappear unless you flag it
