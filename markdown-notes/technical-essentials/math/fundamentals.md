## Least Sqaures Fit

- A "best-fitting" method through a set of data points to minimize the sum of squared errors between observed data and model predictions
- Squaring serves to:
  - Make all errors positive
  - Penalize large deviations more heavily than small ones
  - Provide a closed-form solution in linear regression
- Applications include:
  - Data fitting
  - Parameter estimation
    - Remove system parameters from estimation
  - Signal processing
    - Smoothing noisy signals
  - Machine learning / statistics
    - Core technique for supervised learning when fitting to data
  - Engineering physics
    - Curve fitting in experiments
    - Finding physical constants from measured data
  - Computer vision / graphics
    - Pose estimation, fitting geometric shapes
