## Continuous Delivery Movement

- Idea introduced in 2006 during an Agile conference
- Code and infrastructure should always be in a deployable state, such that all code checked into trunk can safely be deployed to production- there needs to be a deployment pipeline

## Lean Movement

- Value stream mapping, kanban boards, and total productive maintenance were codified for the Toyota Production System in 1980s
- Lean Enterprise Institute then applied these concepts to service industry and healthcare…
- Two central beliefs
  - Manufacturing lead time (time required to convert raw materials into finished goods) is the best predictor of quality, customer satisfaction, and employee happiness
  - One of the best predictors of short lead times is small batch sizes of work
