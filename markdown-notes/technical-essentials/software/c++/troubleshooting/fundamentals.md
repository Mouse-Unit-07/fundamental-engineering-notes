## Overview

- All C troubleshooting notes apply
- W/ C++'s various additional features, recommendations include:
  - Leaning on standard libraries for safer/robust alternatives whenever possible
    - Use vectors, strings, etc
  - Using modern C++11 semantics (`{}` uniform initialization, etc) for safer implementations

## Error Handling

- Error handling is a loaded topic that has application specific solutions
- C++ has exceptions built into the language which is great, but it's meant as an option for developers as opposed to a silver bullet to resolve precondition violations & other errors
