  - X86 vs ARM rivalry, RISC-V rising, FPGAs used in datacenters, AI accelerators, GPUs

## 80 Characters

- Back in the day, terminals were cathode ray tubes that displayed 24 lines by 80 columns
- That's it- that arbitrary 80 is why we frequently go by 80 characters per line

## Binary Representation

- ...We've come a long way to get to two's complement, floating point, etc that we have now
- Morse Code
  - Invented by Samuel Finley Breese Morse in 1837
  - It was built on later by others, but Morse code w/ its dots and lines is binary
- Braille
  - Louis Braille invented Braille in 1824
  - The presence/absence of dots is also binary

## Byte

- IBM coined the term "byte" in 1956
- It originally meant the number of bits in a datapath, but was changed to mean 8 bits

## Computer Milestones

- ![computer-milestones](_images/computers/computer-milestones.png)

## Dead Computers Society

- A spin off of the "Dead Poets Society"
- Often used as club and hobbyist group names

## Digital vs Analog Computers

- George Stibitz coined the word "digital" to differentiate new electronic computers from electromechanical computers

## Keyboard Keys

- Shift key
  - "Shift/precedence codes" refers to codes alter the meaning of any following codes until the shift is done
  - There was a "shift" key on old typewriters, and they haven't gone away
- Escape key
  - "Escape codes" refer to codes that escape from some normal interpretation
  - Braille implemented this to indicate that an escaped character should be uppercase rather than lowercase
- Carriage return / line feed
  - Carriage return
    - Refers to the way typewriters had carriages holding paper return to the right side after finishing a line
  - Line feed
    - Refers to the way the carriage on a typewriter is rolled so that you start writing on the next line after finishing a line
- Tab
  - Stands for "horizontal tabulation code" lol
  - It was originally meant to print the next character at the next horizontal position that's a multiple of 8
