## A Rough Timeline

- _BCE_
  - **Ancient Sumerians / Egyptians**
    - Earliest arithmetic for trade, measurement, architecture
  - **Babylonians**
    - Base-60 system, and positional notation
  - **Ancient Greeks**
    - Thales, Pythagoras, Euclid, Aristotle
    - Geometry formalized
    - Aristotle's syllogisms is the foundation of propositional logic / algorithmic reasoning
  - **Romans**
    - Roman numerals (I, V, X, L, C, D, M)
      - C for Centum- Latin for 100
      - M for Mille- Latin for 1000
    - Non-positional, so computations were hard
- _Before 1300 CE_
  - **Indian mathematicians**
    - Aryabhata, Brahmagupta
    - Hindu-Arabic numerals, introduction of 0
  - **Islamic mathematicians**
    - Al-Khwarizmi, Al-kindi
    - Algebra formalized
    - Algorithm (coming from Al-Khwarizmi) coined as a term providing a foundation for computing logic
  - **Leonardo of Pisa, aka Fibonacci**
    - Introduced Hindu-Arabic numerals to Europe
- _1400-1500s_
  - **Renaissance thinkers (Leonardo da Vinci)**
    - Applied mathematics to mechanics, geometry, and perspective

    - Kurt Godel
    - Limitations of formal systems, led to Turning's computability ideas
  - **Alan Turning**
    - Turning machine
      - An abstract mathematical model representing the way any process that can be described in a sequence of steps can be done by a machine
    - Algorithmic computability
  - **Relay circuits**
    - Claude Shannon
    - Applied boolean algebra to relay circuits
    - Established digital circuit theory
