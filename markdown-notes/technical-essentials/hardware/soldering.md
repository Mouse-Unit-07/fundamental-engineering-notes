## IPA

- “isopropyl alcohol”
- C3H70H
- Great for cleaning PCB’s and components because of:
  - Low boiling point, dries quickly
  - Non-conductive
  - Good flux solvent and remover
  - Non-corrosive, safe for metals
- Doesn’t corrode metals even w/ oxygen in its compound because the oxygen is a part of the compound as a hydroxyl group (-OH) attached to a carbon atom, making it an alcohol
  - Alcohols are usually less reactive w/ metals
  - The oxygen atoms aren’t free molecules that can react w/ the metals

## Lead Based Solder

- Lead based solder is easier to work w/ from
  - Lower boiling point
  - Lower viscosity (better flow when soldering)

## Solder Flux

- Solder flux works bc it:
  - Removes metal oxides from pads
    - Copper, tin, nickel, etc start to oxidize immediately when exposed to air, and the oxides prevent solder from wetting metals
  - Lowers surface tension
    - By changing the surface chemistry, solder flux helps the solder spread instead of beading up
  - Cleans the surface
    - Removes contaminants like finger oils, dust, thin corrosion films, etc that prevents solder wetting

## Too Much Heat Dissipation

- When there are large power/ground planes, the heat from a soldering iron is dissipated too well
- ...Solder doesn't melt, or it sticks to the board
- The strat is to use two soldering irons- one to heat the pin and solder and the other to poke and mold the solder to the right shape
