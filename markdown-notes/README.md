# Markdown Notes

- Saved here are Ryuichi's fundamental and supplemental engineering notes from:
  - Key books (...asking ChatGPT for what books to read is probably one of the best ways to use ChatGPT)
  - School
  - Professional experience
- They're here to:
  - Help memorize concepts as they come into our context, and safely forget for when we don't use some details for a long time
  - Share ideas w/ others
  - Avoid making the same mistakes that caused us pain
