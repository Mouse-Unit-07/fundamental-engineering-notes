# How to Learn

- Notes for how to effectively learn
- In parallel to technical knowledge, being conscious of the way we learn, perceive, and behave w/ respect to natural instincts and the way the mind works is so damn essential- whether we're just trying to pass that test tomorrow or make our way around together w/ others that are conscious, thoughtful, and willing

## Overview

- > We are poor judges of when we are learning well and when we're not. When the going is harder and slower and it doesn't feel productive, we are drawn to strategies that feel more fruitful, unaware that the gains from these strategies are often temporary.
  - _Make it Stick: The Science of Successful Learning_
- > Many people believe that their intellectual ability is hardwired from birth, and that failure to meet at learning challenge is an indictment of their native ability. But every time you learn something new, you change the brain- the residue of your experience is stored. It's true that we start life with the gift of our genes, but it's also true that we become capable through the learning and development of mental models that enable us to reason, solve, and create. In other words, the elements that shape your intellectual abilities lie to a surprising extent within your control. Understanding that this is so enables you to see failure as a badge of effort and a source of useful information- then need to dig deeper or to try a different strategy.

- > It is a confounding paradox, then, that the changeable nature of our memory not only can skew our perceptions but also is essential to our ability to learn. As will be familiar to you by now, every time we call up a memory, we make the mind's routes to that memory stronger, an this capacity to strengthen, expand, and modify memory is central to how we deepen our learning and broaden the connections to what we know and what we can do.

- > Paraphrasing the fox in Antoine de Saint-Exupery's The Little Prince (1943), Giroux confidently states: "In geometry, what is essential is invisible to the eye. It is only with the mind that you can see well."

## Dunning-Kruger Effect

- Incompetent people aren't capable of distinguishing the difference between incompetence and competence
- This is called the "Dunning Kruger effect" by psychologists David Dunning and Justin Kruger
- Incompetent people overestimate their own competence, and therefore don't find the need to improve
- This happens thanks to some natural human instincts:
  - People don't like to deliver bad news
    - Or rather, confront the backlash upon delivering the bad news
  - Even after receiving bad news, they need to put in work to tie that to why something went wrong
    - It's a lot easier to blame the tool (or literally anything other than yourself) for why something went wrong than to blame yourself
    - It also doesn't help that everything has to go right for success, as opposed to the frequency at which things can go wrong
  - We're just bad at measuring how competent others are
    - We're not fungus zombies that have our conscience tied together- we're independent humans w/ inefficient ways to communicate

## Elaboration

- Aka, building on foundation of prior knowledge
- By rewording the new information and linking to what you already know, there's no limit to how much you can learn
- Putting things in your own words is to put ideas into a larger context, and to shave off bloat to reveal underlying principles and rules

## Entrenching to Memory

- Memory is durable if:
  - You've firmly and thoroughly comprehended a concept
  - There's practical importance or keen emotional weight
  - It connects to other knowledge in memory

## Extract Underlying Principles/Rules

- Differentiating problems by underlying principles/rules links to both higher problem solving accuracy and better learning quality (via building in prior knowledge and placing ideas into larger contexts)
- Proficiency w/ organizing skills and knowledge by underlying principles builds more than just raw knowledge- it builds "know-how" to both continue building and to tackle completely new ideas and fields

## Foundation of Prior Knowledge

- To learn something new, there needs to be a foundation of prior knowledge that relates to what was newly learned
- If learned concepts build on top of one another, there's no limit to how much you can learn

## Hunger for Narratives

- > Each of us has a different narrative that has many threads woven into it from our shared culture and experience of being human, as well as many distinct threads that explain the singular events of one's personal past. All these experiences influence what comes to mind in a current situation and the narratives through which you make sense of it: Why nobody in my family attended college until me. Why my father never made a fortune in business. Why I'd never want to work in a corporation, or, maybe, Why I would never want to work for myself. We gravitate to the narratives that best explain our emotions. In this way, narrative and memory become one. The memories we organize meaningfully become those that are better remembered. Narrative provides not only meaning but also a mental framework for imbuing future experiences and information with meaning, in effect shaping new memories to fit our established constructs of the world and ourselves.
  - _Make it Stick: The Science of Successful Learning_
- We're naturally uncomfortable w/ ambiguity and arbitrary events
- This is a survival instinct to help our decision making as we find ourselves in situations we've been in before

## Individual Differences

- People's brains vary physically- cortical folds, strengths and densities of cortical connections
- ...But as a species, we're all the same
  > Our individuality is real, but it should not be exaggerated: each of us is but a variation on the Homo sapiens melody line. In any of us, black or white, Asian or Native American, anywhere on the planet, the human brain architecture is obvious. In that respect, the cortex of any human differs from that of our closest living relative, the chimpanzee, just as much as any improvisation on "My Funny Valentine" departs from, say, one on "My Romance."
  >
  > Because we all share the same initial brain structure, the same core knowledge, and the same learning algorithms that allow us to acquire additional talents, we often end up sharing the same concepts. The same human potential is present in every person- be it for reading, science, or mathematics, and whether we are blind, deaf, or mute.
  >
  > [...] In brief, individual differences are real- but they are almost always of degree rather than of kind. It is only at the extremes of the normal distribution of brain organization that neurobiological variations end up making a real cognitive difference. Increasingly, we are discovering that children with developmental disorders lie on the ends of this distribution. Their brains seem to have taken a wrong turn on the developmental path that leads from genetic inheritance to neuronal and circuit self-organization during pregnancy.

## Interleaved and Varied Practice

- Interleaving and varying practice makes retrieval harder, which improves learning quality
- When you have a collection of different but related practice items, it also creates a network of cues that further entrenches your memory

## IQ

- Rather than IQ, it's discipline, grit, and a growth mindset that empowers people w/ a sense of possibility, creativity, and persistence required for successful and higher learning

## Learning Styles

- Myth- there's no empirical evidence supporting that we should be learning w/ one medium or another
- It's the quality of the underlying retrieval that correlates to learning
- ...I guess the takeaway is that all you need is to be able to tolerate the method of learning
  - If you can't stand just listening for hours, then it ain't it
  - But once you have a setup that you can tolerate, it's plenty
- There a bunch of proposed models of "learning styles" and "types of intelligence" that aren't backed by evidence
  - Fluid vs crystalized intelligence
  - Logical-mathematical, spatial, linguistic, kinesthetic, musical, interpersonal, intrapersonal, naturalistic intelligence
  - Analytical, creative, practical intelligence
  - We can juggle these around as food for thought, but they're not to depend on

## Mnemonics

- Mnemonics work- it's how memory champions memorize handfuls of decks of cards in 2 minutes
- They work because they're explicit cues- again, we can infinitely remember things, we just need a strong hold of the cues to bring them up
- For valuable and long term applications, mnemonics are best used as ways to organize what you've learned rather than as an initial way of learning
  - ...Otherwise you'll be stuck w/ a pile of mnemonics that may or may not make intuitive sense later and you'll be working hard to remember your list of cues

## Nutrition

- We all need a balanced diet, oxygenation, and physical exercise to allow our brains to do their work
- It's especially relevant for growing children during their "sensitive period" of plasticity:
- > [...] This plasticity is neither infinite nor magical: it is a strictly material process that requires specific nutritional and energetic inputs, and even a few weeks of deprivation can lead to permanent deficits. And because the organization of the brain is highly modular, these deficits may be restricted to a specific cognitive domain, such as grammar or vocabulary. The pediatric literature is full of similar examples. I could have mentioned, for instance, fetal alcohol syndrome, which is caused by exposure of the fetus to alcohol ingested by the mother. Alcohol is a teratogen, a substance that causes embryonic malformations of the body and brain: it is a true poison for the developing nervous system, one that should clearly be avoided throughout pregnancy. For dendritic trees to thrive, the garden of the brain must be provided with all the nutrients it needs.

## Organize Key Ideas Into Mental Models

- Mental model
  - Mental representation of some external reality
- ...This is where biases and stereotypes arise from- we make associations between realities (sometimes incorrectly) to remember things and simplify real-time perception
- In exchange, they're efficient skills / knowledge structures

## Pay Attention to Cues

- As in, be conscious of how we have cues to retrieve thoughts in memory, and the cues associated w/ each memory
- Feeling familiar or fluent doesn't mean anything
- Ease of retrieval **after some delay** is a good indicator of learning

## Place Ideas into Larger Contexts

- > For example, the more of the unfolding story of history you know, the more of it you can learn. And the more ways you give that story meaning, say by connecting it to your understanding of human ambition and the untidiness of fate, the better the story stays with you.
  - _Make it Stick: The Science of Successful Learning_
- Good storytellers make use of this- when there's a moral or message that's conveyed through a journey, you immerse yourself in the story
- A collection of details and fragments that don't speak to any larger context that you have a grasp of doesn't stick to memory

## Rereading Text, Massed Practice

- Horrible
- It's a waste of time to constantly re-read something or repeat the same practice back to back without delay
- There needs to be a variation in what you practice to allow for some time to forget to practice meaningful retrieval of skills in memory
- You burn something into memory best when it takes some effort to remember something, and you put in that effort to successfully remember that something
- Rereading should be done after you make an effort to recall the contents of what you're about to read

## Retrieval

- The harder a thought is to retrieve, the better you'll remember after successful retrieval
  - ...So what we need to do is forget what we want to remember, and then manually retrieve it after forgetting to entrench thoughts into our memory
- The easier a thought is to retrieve, the less benefit there is in each successful retrieval speaking in terms of long term memory
- This is because "neurons that fire together, wire together"- the opposite is also true where synapses that aren't frequently heard are weakened
- Testing is almost always treated as a tool for measuring learning, but testing is the best tool for learning- effective self testing leads to effective learning
  - Taking a moment to review what you learned and asking yourself questions to test yourself is called "reflection"
  - Reflection is meaningful as a retrieval attempt, elaboration via rewording and expanding what you learned, and generation as an attempt to recreate what you learned on your own without external help
- Retrieval difficulty is a function of:
  - Current context
  - Recent use
  - Number and vividness of cues you have
- > Consider your expertise to be in a state of continuing development, practice dynamic testing as a learning strategy to discover your weaknesses, and focus on improving yourself in those areas. It's smart to build in your strengths, but you will become ever more competent and versatile if you also use testing and trial and error to continue to improve in the areas where your knowledge or performance are not pulling their weight.
  - _Make it Stick: The Science of Successful Learning_

## Space Out Practice

- Allowing some forgetting to settle in between practice sessions allows retrieval to get harder, which makes each practice/recall session more meaningful
- This can be done naturally if you interleave different practices together

## Susceptibility to Illusions

- > The truth is that we're all hardwired to make errors in judgment. Good judgment is a skill one must acquire, becoming an astute observer of one's own thinking and performance. We start at a disadvantage for several reasons. One is that when we're incompetent, we tend to overestimate our competence and see little reason to change. Another is that, as humans, we are readily misled by illusions, cognitive biases, and the stories we construct to explain the world around us and our place within it. To become more competent, or even expert, we must learn to recognize competence when we see it in others, become more accurate judges of what we ourselves know and don't know, adopt learning strategies that get results, and find objective ways to track our progress.
  - _Make it Stick: The Science of Successful Learning_
- We're easily incorrectly convinced that we know or can do something
- We need to take our "System 1" as per _Thinking, Fast and Slow_ for a grain of salt and run verifications
- We also naturally fill in the gaps
  - Memory is a reconstruction- we can't remember everything, so we inject our own details (even if they're wrong) to make a more logical story / narrative
- **Imagination inflation**
  - There's a tendency for us to believe that an event actually occurred if you're asked to imagine an event vividly
  - It's called "imagination inflation"
- **Suggestion**
  - Illusion from the way a question is asked
  - "WHY CAN'T YOU LISTEN TO ME??"
- **Inference**
  - When unrelated events distort memory
  - If you're shown a bunch of pictures of potential suspects for a crime one day, and some days later you're asked to recall who you saw in a crime scene, you might mistakenly claim someone you saw in the pictures to have been present in the crime scene
- **Curse of knowledge**
  - Underestimation of how long it takes for someone to learn something that we've already learned
  - This is why it's so hard for you to teach- there needs to be a conscious effort made to place ourselves in someone's feet, or our own feet back before you learned
  - Our System 1 omits the learning process when retrieving and trying to teach
    - This means people omit what they first did- the observational approach
    - There's a process to learning where we all first observe -> interpret -> create our own mental models and reduce down to underlying principles
    - If you throw just your interpretation of what the underlying principles at someone, they can be taken as incoherent details that float around in the mind to be quickly cleaned up and thrown away
    - Teaching is about the way in which you place down the rails for someone to come to conclusions on their own
    - This is why feedback is crucial for students- to steer them back on to the rails or towards the goal as they struggle on their own
- **Feeling of knowing**
  - Events that are familiar to you give off a "feeling of knowing"
  - Hearing/experiencing something that's familiar is naturally comforting- without a conscious effort to evaluate what you're hearing, people have a tendency to start believing something that's been repeated over and over
- **Fluency illusions**
  - Fluency with a text or media gives off an illusion that you're fluent w/ the material covered
  - This is why just rereading/reviewing something over and over is dangerous- you'll convince yourself that the material is simple and that you've mastered it
    - Nah, you've just proven that you're capable of reading (or listening or watching, etc)
- **Social influence**
  - Aka, "memory conformity", or "social contagion of memory"
  - Our memories are influenced by the memories of the people around us
  - If you retell a story and someone adds a detail (false or true), you have a tendency to add that to your own vivid memory
- **False consensus effect**
  - We have a tendency to believe that others believe what we individually believe
  - We all perceive the world in a different way- we need to consciously account for how we're all different

## Teams

- "Teams" are groups consisting of people w/ complementary areas of expertise
- You get little out of a group of people that all think the same way

## Try it Before Being Taught

- If you try to figure out how to do something before being taught the answer, you'll better remember the answer whether you got it right or not
- ...This is difficult if you're going through a textbook for the first time, or don't have the time to work on trying to remember (as you would to try and recall who the director of an anime movie's name in your idle time), but whenever possible you should try throwing a dart at what you're about to learn before being taught
- Trying something before being taught is called "generation"
